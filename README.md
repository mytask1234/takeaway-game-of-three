# Game of Three
This is my solution for the 'Game of Three' - Coding Challenge.  
It is a Spring-Boot project, based on Maven.

* To run the application and play the game, issue the following command from the project home directory:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
* Then, access the following url, from two different browser session windows/tabs:
```
http://localhost:8080/game.html
```

Hope you like it :)
